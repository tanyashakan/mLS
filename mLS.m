% The Pupose Of The Script And The Input Parametes 
% This script is provided for the accurate estimation of landslide-event
% magnitude. We used Matlab R2015b to test the given script. It basically
% requires three input parameters to estimate landslide-event magnitude: 
% cutoff smallest area that follows power law)and beta (power-law exponent)
% values of frequency-size distribution (FAD) of landslides, and a horizontal
% array (Area) with landslide sizes. This script can also calculate the
% uncertainty in landslide-event magnitude if uncertainties in cutoff and
% beta values are given as input parameters.

% The power-law distribution can be captured in both cumulative and 
% non-cumulative FADs, and the power-law exponent (?) for a non-cumulative 
% FAD can be transferred to its cumulative equivalent, ?, using the relation 
% ?=?-1 (Guzzetti et al., 2002). In this code, the calculations are carried 
% out on the non-cumulative FAD.

% The cutoff is the landslide size where frequency-size distribution curve
% diverges form the power-law. In this code its unit is meter square.

% Beta value resfers to the slope of the frequency-size distribution. It also
% called as power-law exponent (scaling parameter, ?). For most landslide
% inventories, non-cumulative power-law exponents occur in the range of 
% 1.4–3.4, with a central tendency of 2.3–2.5 (Stark and Guzzetti, 2009;
% Van Den Eeckhaut et al., 2007).

% The unit of landslide sizes are in meter square.

% To obtain the cutoff & beta values and thier uncertainties the method
% suggested by Clauset et al.(2009) can be used. The original scripts 
% (plfit.m and plvar.m) of Clauset et al. (2009) can be downloaded from the
% following link to calculate these parameters: 
% http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/ 

% The Output Of The Script
% When you run the mLS function, for the given sample data, the corresponding 
% mLS (landslide-event magnitude) will be obtained. If the uncertainties in 
% cutoff (cutoff_error) and beta (beta_error) values are provided, the
% uncertainty in mLS (error) is also estimated by the script. As an output
% of this code, a plot showing the frequency-area distribution of the given 
% landslides and the corresponding power-law fit are also obtained.
% mLS does not have any unit.

% In the following lines, the bins are defined with an array. We took 2 as 
% the minimum bin size and we used increasing bin sizes. We increase the 
% bin widths while the landslide size increases, so that bin widths become
% approximately equal in logarithmic coordinates. To create a long array for 
% the bins we tentatively pick 120 for the size of x1 vector defined below.
